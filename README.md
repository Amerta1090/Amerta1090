# Hi there, I'm Abdul Majid! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I’m Abdul Majid, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast who pretends to understand every new trend in AI, IoT, and Web Development. My superpower? Spamming GitHub repos with code that might work if the stars align. Currently diving deep into machine learning, but who needs sleep, right? 🤷‍♂️
- 💻 I’m pretending to be an AI expert while struggling with basic Python syntax.
- 🌱 My daily goal is to figure out how to deploy something on the cloud without breaking anything.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on projects where I can learn new things and break even more stuff!

## 📌 Fun Fact

I enjoy pretending to know what I'm doing with tech while actually Googling 90% of the time. If you want to join me on this wild ride, let's connect and make something (hopefully) work! 🤖✨

Feel free to explore my repos, or don’t. Either way, I’m probably in the middle of re-writing everything. 😄
